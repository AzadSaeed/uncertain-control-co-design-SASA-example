# uncertain-control-co-design-SASA-example
This code creates the reults for the deterministic control co-design, stochastic in expectation uncertain control co-design, and worst-case robust uncertain control co-design for the simple SASA case study.
The results are associated with the following article: "Investigations into uncertain control co-design implementations for stochastic in expectation and worst-case robust" IMECE2022-95229
