# uncertain-control-co-design-SASA-example
This code creates the reults for the deterministic control co-design, stochastic in expectation uncertain control co-design, and worst-case robust uncertain control co-design for the simple SASA case study.
The results are associated with the following article: 
Azad,S., and Herber, D. R., 2022."Investigations into uncertain control co-design implementations for stochastic in expectation and worst-case robust". In International Mechanical Engineering Congress & Exposition, no. IMECE2022-95229

Start by openning the Main.m files which contains seven different case studies associated with the porblems discussed in the above-mentioned article.
